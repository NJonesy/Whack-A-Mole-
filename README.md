# Whack-A-Mole-

@group tomorrow presentations , every presentation last 6 mins , go over your code , what was a win, what you've been struggling with , what would you have done differently if you had to do it again , what you've learnt during the project , there will be questions at the end of each presentations 

Initial Aims:

- At the most basic level, I set out to have a board of buttons appearing and dissapearing randomly, dissapearing with a click, the game running on a time frame. 

    - HTML and CSS was fairly quick and straight forward until this point. That said I initially used an HTML table, and was advised to change that to a 'ul' 'li' grid, when I got in on Monday. 
    
    - Over the weekend I managed to get a random button appearing when I clicked 'Play' and then dissapearing when clicked, and a 
      new button appearing randomly. The next step, getting random fade in and out to run independantly proved way more tricky. Needed help to implement the game playing (true), not playing (false). Once that was in place it gave a simple, logic sructuring the code.

Where I got to:

    - Clear board button - hides cops

    - Whack Button - first cop appears randomly.

    - Random appearance and dissapearance.

    - Game runs for a minute. Time starts when 'Whack' is clicked.

    - Score increases for every click.

    - Sound for each click.

    - Cursor changes to image over button.

    - Button is a cop gif.

    - Backgroung image.

    - Downloaded themed font.


Features still to add:

    - Timer. Started this by downloading a plug in.

    - Music. Play Deep Cover when whack is clicked and stop when time runs out.

    - Reset button.

    - 2 player. 

    - Difficulty levels.


Challenges/What I would have done differently/What I learned:

    - Planning. Should have used Trelo. Time management, setting deadlines and moving on

    - Focusing on one thing at a time.

    - Accepting when heading down the wrong path and re-writing code rather than ploughing on and wasting more time.

    - Feel more confident in my understanding of the code as a whole. What each function/variable is achieving, how they work together. Where to position things, scope. Thinking about logic in simple terms before rushing ahead and not really understanding what I'm doing.

    - More comfortable with JQuery logic and syntax. Generally think I can now see what needs to be implemeneted and feel more confident in how to implement.
